## How does it work? 

1. The codebase works by firstly reading all the JSON files in the recipes folder. 
2. Once the JSON's have been processed they are passed to the GUI and displayed in a list
3. When one of the list items is clicked it will run automation scripts which add a reminder to my reminders app
4. The reminders app is an app available on mac and iphone.
5. The iCloud then syncs the items in my list to my phone so I can go to the shops and get the stuff I need.
